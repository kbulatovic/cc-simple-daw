# Trying to make a DAW app

## What works?

Almost nothing, but the basic structure is there.

## Thins to do for next CC

- [ ] Add a way to add tracks
- [ ] Fix playback in the sequencer
- [x] ~~Fix drag and drop panels~~
- [ ] Basic quantization (snap to grid)
- [ ] Make more robust and intuitive keyboard interface
- [ ] Drag and drop pads to switch between them, so it's easier to switch between them
